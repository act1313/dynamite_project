                        Even with the new improved detonator, nitroglycerin was still highly volatile. In 1867, Nobel hoped to fix this problem with the invention of dynamite, a mixture of nitroglycerin and diatomaceous earth (similar to chalk). The mixture of the two substances made a dry, but still powerful, version of nitroglycerin. Dynamite was safer to use and handle than regular nitroglycerin. Nobel received patents for dynamite in Great Britain in 1867 and the U.S. in 1868. Dynamite was then used at large scale in making tunnels and canals and buidling roads and railways.
